# Node Docker Setup - IOTA Mainnet
This setup lets you run an [IOTA Hornet node](https://wiki.iota.org/hornet/welcome) and additional services using Docker and Traefik as [a reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) to enable (optional) TLS using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), control access to your node and route requests to the correct endpoints.

See [this guide](https://wiki.iota.org/hornet/how_tos/using_docker) to set up your node.
